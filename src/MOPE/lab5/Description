Experimenter it`s a class which control all process.
On the start main creates Experimenter with parameters given by var
  In constructor
  1.new Experiment is created class and experimental table is filled by factors for our experiment.
    In parenting class was changed type of table int -> double. was refactored methods
  2. Table with experimental values is filled for given param(on start m = 3)
  3. Creates class which contained all check methods(It`s in Lab 3 Methods and tables have been supplemented for new parameters)
  4. start of algorithm
  Algorithm
  1. Check for homogeneity(there is cycle which ends only when m is correct)
  2. Generate naturalized coefficients of regression equation. For this purpose are created:
     Table-row with medium values of x in each column(first row and first column)
     Table with a values(all other space in matrix)
     Table column with medium values of y(answers column)
     Calculate every coefficient by division appropriate determinant on main(determinant is calculated in class that was created in lab3)
  3. Substitute coefficients in our equations, calculate and compare with middle value of y in this row
  4. After that make Student and Fisher check in the proven methods that were created for lab 3(only table additions were needed)
  5. Show result with class GUI(lab4)
